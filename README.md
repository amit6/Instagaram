# Instagaram

This application is still in progress(Cosmetic, icons and some other functionality needs to be fixed), but basic things works.

Wes Bos's tutorials helped me to understand redux. Any one looking for quick start can refer https://learnredux.com/

To run this application, execute the following commands:

  1. Install NPM modules

    ```
    $ npm install (or yarn install)
    ```

  2. Start the front-end server:

    ```
    $ npm start
    ```
